# Alpine Linux (musl libc) cannot resolve Docker container hostnames via
# Python's socket module because musl's DNS resolver fails against Docker's
# embedded DNS server (127.0.0.11) in some CI environments, even though
# busybox's nslookup (which makes direct UDP queries) works fine.
#
# By adding /etc/hosts entries via nslookup first, Python's resolver uses the
# "files" path from nsswitch.conf and succeeds without touching DNS at all.
